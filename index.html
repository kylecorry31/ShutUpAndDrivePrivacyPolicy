    <h4>User Data Policy</h4>
    <p>I do not collect any of your information - none of the information required by the app is sent to a server (the app doesn't even have a server!).</p>
    <p>Shut Up &amp; Drive! requires the phone and contact permissions to detect when you are receiving a phone call and then read out the name of the contact who is calling for you to hear.</p>
    <p>Shut Up &amp; Drive! uses the activity recognition and location permissions to determine if you are driving, so it can automatically enable driving mode.</p>
    <p>Shut Up &amp; Drive! also uses SMS permissions to send auto reply texts to people who may message you while driving.</p>
    <b>All features which use these permission can be toggled on or off, and none will be in use while Shut Up &amp; Drive! is not activated.</b>
